## 1. Avocado Baked Eggs

Give your usual breakfast routine a delicious twist with these creamy avocado baked eggs. Cut an avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop out a small portion of the flesh to make room for the egg.

In a bowl, mix together 1 cup of almond flour, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 2 tablespoons of coconut flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, a pinch of salt, and 4 beaten eggs. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat, pour small scoops of the batter onto the skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides. Serve with sugar-free syrup or your favorite keto-friendly toppings.

## 3. Ham and Cheese Egg Muffins

These ham and cheese egg muffins are perfect for meal prepping your breakfast for the week. In a bowl, whisk together 6 eggs, 1/4 cup of heavy cream, salt, and pepper.
