Are you following a keto diet but don't want to give up on fast food? Good news! Many fast food restaurants now offer keto-friendly options that allow you to enjoy a quick and convenient meal while staying on track with your low-carb lifestyle. From burgers to salads, here are some of the best keto-friendly fast food options available.

### In-N-Out Burger [^1^] [#keto #fastfood]

In-N-Out Burger is a popular fast food chain known for its fresh ingredients and customizable menu. To make your meal keto-friendly, order your burger "protein style," which means replacing the bun with lettuce leaves. You can also add extra toppings like cheese, bacon, and avocado to make it more satisfying. Don't forget to skip the ketchup and opt for mustard instead.

### Chipotle [^2^] [#keto #fastfood]

Chipotle is famous for its build-your-own Mexican-inspired bowls. To keep it keto-friendly, go for a bowl or salad and choose a base of lettuce or cauliflower rice. Add a protein like grilled chicken, steak, or carnitas, and top it off with guacamole, cheese, salsa, and sour cream. Skip the rice, beans, and tortillas to avoid unnecessary carbs.

### Five Guys [^3^] [#keto #fastfood]

Five Guys is a burger joint that offers customizable burgers made to order. Like In-N-Out, you can order your burger "bun-less" and wrap it in lettuce. Load it up with toppings like bacon, cheese, mushrooms, and jalapenos. Five Guys also offers keto-friendly hot dogs, which you can enjoy without the bun. Don't forget to pair your meal with a side of bunless hot dogs or a fresh salad.

### Subway [^4^] [#keto #fastfood]

Subway may be known for its footlong sandwiches, but you can still enjoy a keto-friendly meal there. Opt for a salad instead of a sandwich and choose a protein like chicken, turkey, or roast beef. Load up on low-carb veggies like spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Skip the high-carb dressings and opt for olive oil, vinegar, or a light mayo.

### Chick-fil-A [^5^] [#keto #fastfood]

Chick-fil-A is a beloved fast food chain famous for its chicken sandwiches and nuggets. To keep it keto-friendly, order a grilled chicken sandwich without the bun or get the nuggets. Pair it with a side of grilled vegetables or a side salad with a low-carb dressing. Avoid the high-carb sauces like barbecue and honey mustard.

### Wendy's [^6^] [#keto #fastfood]

Wendy's is known for its tasty burgers, and you can enjoy a keto-friendly meal there too. Order your burger without the bun and add extra toppings like cheese, bacon, and avocado. You can also customize their salads by opting for a base of lettuce or spinach and adding protein like grilled chicken or bacon. Choose a low-carb dressing like ranch or Caesar.

Remember, while these options are considered keto-friendly, it's essential to make mindful choices and be aware of hidden added sugars or carbs. Always check the nutritional information on the restaurant's website or mobile app to make informed decisions that align with your keto diet goals. So next time you're in a hurry and need a quick bite, try out these keto-friendly options at your favorite fast food joints!
