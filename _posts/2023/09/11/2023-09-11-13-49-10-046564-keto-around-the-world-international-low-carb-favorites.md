## 4. Japan: Sashimi and Cauliflower Rice

Sushi lovers rejoice! You can satisfy your cravings for Japanese cuisine without derailing your keto progress.

Don't forget to dip your sashimi in gluten-free soy sauce or a keto-friendly alternative. #ketoJapanese #lowcarbJapanese #sashimi

## 5. Greece: Greek Salad with Feta Cheese

Transport yourself to the sunny Mediterranean with a refreshing and flavorful Greek salad. This traditional dish is already low in carbs, but you can make it even more keto-friendly by omitting high-carb ingredients like croutons and reducing the number of tomatoes. Load your salad with fresh cucumbers, bell peppers, Kalamata olives, red onions, feta cheese, and a drizzle of olive oil. It's a delightful and healthy option for a light lunch or side dish. #ketoGreek #lowcarbGreek #GreekSalad

Thai cuisine is known for its intricate flavors and unique combination of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy.

Add shrimp, chicken, or tofu and garnish with crushed peanuts and lime wedges for an authentic Thai experience. #ketoThai #lowcarbThai #PadThai
