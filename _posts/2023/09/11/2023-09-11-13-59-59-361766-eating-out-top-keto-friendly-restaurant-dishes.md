Eating out while trying to stick to a keto diet can be a challenge. Many restaurant dishes are loaded with carbs, making it difficult to find suitable options. However, with a little bit of knowledge and research, you can still enjoy a delicious meal while staying on track with your ketogenic lifestyle. In this blog post, we will explore some of the top keto-friendly dishes you can find at restaurants.

## 1. Grilled Steak with Vegetables (+ Steak Sauce)

A juicy grilled steak is always a great keto option when dining out. Most restaurants offer a variety of steaks, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon, which are high in protein and low in carbs. Pair your steak with a side of steamed or roasted non-starchy vegetables like broccoli or asparagus. To add extra flavor, drizzle some steak sauce on top, but make sure to choose a low-carb option.

## 2. Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad

A classic Caesar salad can be a great choice for keto dieters. Opt for grilled chicken breast instead of breaded or fried chicken to keep the dish low in carbs. Be mindful of the dressing, as some Caesar dressings contain added sugars. Choose a dressing that is made with keto-friendly ingredients, or ask for olive oil and vinegar to keep it simple and low-carb.

## 3. Bunless Burgers or Lettuce Wrap Burgers

Burgers are a popular choice when eating out, and you can still enjoy them on a keto diet. Simply ask for your burger without the bun or opt for a lettuce wrap instead. Load up your burger with toppings like cheese, bacon, avocado, and saut√©ed mushrooms to make it extra flavorful. Most restaurants also offer a side of salad or steamed vegetables as an alternative to fries.

## 4. Grilled Fish with Green Beans (+ Lemon Butter Sauce)

If you're in the mood for seafood, grilled fish is an excellent keto-friendly option. Choose fish varieties like salmon, trout, or cod, as they are high in healthy fats and low in carbs. Pair your fish with a side of green beans, which are relatively low in net carbs. To add some zest, drizzle a lemon butter sauce over your fish for a burst of flavor.

## 5. Cauliflower Crust Pizza

Craving pizza? Many restaurants now offer cauliflower crust as a low-carb alternative. Cauliflower crust is made from grated cauliflower and cheese, resulting in a tasty and satisfying base for your favorite pizza toppings. Load up your pizza with low-carb ingredients like cheese, vegetables, and grilled chicken or shrimp for a delicious keto-friendly meal.

## 6. Zucchini Noodles with Pesto Sauce

Pasta lovers can still enjoy a satisfying meal while following a keto diet. Many restaurants now offer zucchini noodles, also known as "zoodles," as a substitute for traditional pasta. Zucchini noodles are low in carbs and can be paired with a variety of keto-friendly sauces, such as pesto or marinara sauce. Add some grilled chicken or shrimp for extra protein and flavor.

## Conclusion

Eating out doesn't have to derail your keto diet. By choosing the right dishes and making simple substitutions, you can enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal while staying in ketosis. Try out these top keto-friendly restaurant dishes and enjoy dining out without compromising your health goals.
