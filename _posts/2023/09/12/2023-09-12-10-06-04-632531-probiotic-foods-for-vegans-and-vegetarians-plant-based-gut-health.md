Maintaining a healthy gut is essential for overall well-being, and one way to achieve this is by including probiotic foods in your diet. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide numerous health benefits, particularly for the digestive system. While many probiotic sources are dairy-based, there are plenty of plant-based options suitable for vegans and vegetarians. In this article, we will explore some of the best probiotic foods for those following a plant-based diet.

### 1. Sauerkraut

Sauerkraut is a fermented cabbage dish that originated in Germany. It is rich in probiotics and contains Lactobacillus bacteria, which promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This tangy and crunchy food can be enjoyed on its own or added to salads, sandwiches, and wraps for an extra dose of probiotics. #plantbased #vegan #probiotics

Enjoy it straight from the bottle or use it as a base for mocktails and cocktails. #kombucha #vegan #probiotics
